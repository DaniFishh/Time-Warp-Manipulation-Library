**Time-Warp-Manipulation** is a powerful NPM package that allows you to manipulate time in your JavaScript or TypeScript applications. With this library you can freeze time, accelerate or decelerate time flow, and even monkey-patch the global `Date` object for testing or simulation purposes. Whether you‚Äôre writing tests that rely on time or building advanced time-based features, Time-Warp-Manipulation gives you full control over time.

Currently available on NPM: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/time-warp-manipulation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/time-warp-manipulation)

## Features

- **Freeze Time:** Lock the current time to a specific timestamp.
- **Time Acceleration:** Speed up or slow down the passage of time with a configurable multiplier.
- **Monkey-Patch Global Date:** Optionally replace the global `Date` object so that all code sees the manipulated time.
- **Virtual Time Object:** Retrieve a virtual time interface for advanced use cases without affecting the global environment.
- **TypeScript Support:** Fully written in TypeScript with complete type definitions.
- **ESM Compatible:** Compiled with NodeNext module resolution for seamless integration in modern projects.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v14 or higher
- npm v6 or higher

### Install via NPM

```bash
npm install time-warp-manipulation
```

### Install via Yarn

```bash
yarn add time-warp-manipulation
```

## Usage

Time-Warp-Manipulation provides a simple API to manipulate time for testing, simulations, or any time-based functionality. You can either work with a virtual time object or monkey-patch the global `Date` object.

### Basic Usage

Below is a simple example that freezes time, logs the frozen timestamp, then accelerates time and finally restores the original behavior.

```ts
import {
  enableTimeWarp,
  disableTimeWarp,
  setTimeWarpOptions,
  getVirtualTime,
} from "time-warp-manipulation";

// Freeze time at Jan 1, 2030, 00:00:00 UTC
// The timestamp for Jan 1, 2030, 00:00:00 UTC is 1893456000000 ms since the Unix epoch.
enableTimeWarp({
  freezeAt: new Date("2030-01-01T00:00:00Z").getTime(),
  monkeyPatch: true,
});

console.log("Frozen time (global Date):", Date.now());
// Expected output: 1893456000000 every time

// Update time settings: unfreeze and accelerate time by a factor of 5.
// With acceleration, 1 real second will simulate 5 seconds of "warped" time.
setTimeWarpOptions({
  freezeAt: null,
  speed: 5,
  monkeyPatch: false, // Optional: if already monkey-patched, this may be omitted
});

// Retrieve a virtual time object (does not affect global Date)
const vTime = getVirtualTime();
console.log("Accelerated virtual time:", vTime.now());

// When done, restore the original Date behavior.
disableTimeWarp();
console.log("Restored real time (global Date):", Date.now());
```

### Advanced Time Manipulation

For more advanced use cases, you can update TimeWarp options dynamically or use the virtual time object without monkey-patching the global `Date` object:

```ts
import {
  enableTimeWarp,
  setTimeWarpOptions,
  getVirtualTime,
  disableTimeWarp,
} from "time-warp-manipulation";

// Enable TimeWarp without monkey-patching, using a virtual time object only.
enableTimeWarp({ monkeyPatch: false });

// Get the virtual time interface
const virtualTime = getVirtualTime();

// Log the current virtual time
console.log("Initial virtual time:", virtualTime.now());

// Update options to accelerate time by 3x
setTimeWarpOptions({ speed: 3 });
console.log("Virtual time after acceleration:", virtualTime.now());

// Optionally, you can disable TimeWarp entirely.
disableTimeWarp();
console.log("TimeWarp disabled, real time:", Date.now());
```

## API Reference

### `enableTimeWarp(options?: TimeWarpOptions): void`

- **Description:** Initializes the time manipulation according to the provided options. If `monkeyPatch` is `true`, the global `Date` object is replaced with a manipulated version.
- **Parameters:**
  - `freezeAt`: A timestamp (in milliseconds) to freeze time at. If provided, time will remain constant.
  - `speed`: A multiplier to accelerate or decelerate time. (e.g., `2` for double speed)
  - `monkeyPatch`: If set to `true`, replaces the global `Date` with the manipulated version.

### `disableTimeWarp(): void`

- **Description:** Restores the original global `Date` object and disables time manipulation.

### `setTimeWarpOptions(options: TimeWarpOptions): void`

- **Description:** Updates the current time manipulation settings (e.g., unfreezing or changing the speed).

### `getVirtualTime(): VirtualTime`

- **Description:** Returns a virtual time object containing:
  - `now()`: The current manipulated time in milliseconds.
  - `Date`: The custom Date constructor that uses the manipulated time.

---

## Testing

The package includes a comprehensive Jest test suite to verify its functionality.

### Running Tests

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run tests:**

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

Test files are located in the `__tests__` directory and cover scenarios such as freezing time, accelerating time, monkey-patching the global `Date`, and updating time options.
